    "\n",
    "Tips\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "**To build the molecule:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `ase` (Atomic Simulation Environment) python package. It has a function `ase.build.molecule` that can generate a benzene molecule. Look at its documentation (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/build/build.html#ase.build.molecule) to understand how to use it. Add at least 5 Ang of vacuum!\n",
    "\n",
    "**To write the molecule to a file:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`ase` will give you an `ase.Atoms` object. You can convert it to `sisl` with `sisl.Geometry.new(ase_atoms)`. Then you can write it to an fdf file as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the molecule before writing it to make sure that it is what you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run the SIESTA calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need the Hamiltonian, so don't forget to tell siesta to store it in a `.TSHS` file by using `TS.HS.Save true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To read the Hamiltonian:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the SIESTA run has finished, you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sisl.get_sile(\"path/to/my/file.fdf\").read_hamiltonian()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "as we have done in previous lab sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To compute wavefunctions on the grid:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute $\\psi (\\vec{r})$ you need three things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The eigenstate coefficients.** Once you have a hamiltonian, you can get all of them with `H.eigenstate()`. Then you can loop this object to get each individual eigenstate. Each eigenstate has its energy stored under the `.eig` property.\n",
    "2. **A grid of points in space.** You can create one with `sisl.Grid(geometry, shape=(100, 100, 100))`. This will create a grid of $100x100x100$ points within the cell of your geometry.\n",
    "3. **A function to project the wavefunction into the grid.** The eigenstate object has a `wavefunction` method ([docs](https://zerothi.github.io/sisl/api/generated/sisl.physics.electron.EigenstateElectron.html#sisl.physics.electron.EigenstateElectron.wavefunction)) that will project the wavefunction into an already initialized grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we have done this already on the first SIESTA lab, with a water molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To plot the STM images at a certain height:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is provided to plot molecules at multiple heights. You can use it as it is or modify it as you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: If you have time, you can modify this function to create a plots at multiple voltages. Even a grid of plots at multiple voltages and multiple heights!\n",
    "\n",
    "**To check that things make sense:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can plot all the eigenstates of your system to try to understand if the STM images make sense with something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "H.plot.pdos(data_Erange=[-10, 10], nE=1200, Erange=[-10, 10], kgrid=[1,1,1]).split_DOS(on=\"species+l+m\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Helper: Grids have a `fill` method to set all the values of the grid to a given value, if that is needed."
